# ShareBoard-App
Simple implementation for a board of shares using **MVC** design pattern. A simple ***middleware*** is implemented using sesseion just to check whether a user is registered or not; If a user didn't logged in, they couldn't add a new share; only they could browse the shares of others but without any action.
**ShareBoard*** also has ***validations*** that check for each input value whether it is valid or not.
